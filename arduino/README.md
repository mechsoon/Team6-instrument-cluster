# **ARDUINO CODE ** 

## EXPLANATION
1. assemble the piracer [reference](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/PiRacer_AI_Kit)

2. interrupt pin would be 2 or 3 of your Arduino Shield.

3. when you failed(tx and rx pin on your Arduino would be not blinking.),check your oscillation and CAN SetMode depends on your Shield. 

4. match bitrate between raspberry pi and Arduino is also important.


## How to Use piracer
# virtual python environment
1. cd ~/team6/Team6-instrument-cluster 
2. source venv/bin/activate

# move to cd ~/team6/Team6-instrument-cluster/src
1. rc.py(test for moving)
